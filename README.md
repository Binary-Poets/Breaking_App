This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## What is it?

Breaking_App is an unconventional [React](https://reactjs.org/)-[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate app based on the Breaking Bad tv show.

It's perfect for those who have experience with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) and wants to get started with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and server-side-rendering. This boilerplate covers the fundamentals of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and shows how to use the amazing react [context-api](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) with it. 

Some other notable good thingies it demonstrates: 

```bash
next.js dynamic routing
next/router
next/link
useRef Hook
useState Hook
useContext Hook
useEffect Hook
content refresh interval with useEffect
```


## Getting Started

First, git pull or download the repository. Then

```bash
npm install

#to start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
